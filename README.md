# BoldBot 

This is a project for a selfdriving car that can pick-up tennisballs on a tenniscourt. The car can drive without human interference and register tennisballs up to 3 meters away. 
When a ball is registered it will drive to it and pick it up. 

The project was implemented to get familiar with RaspberryPi, PSOC and a different array of sensors among other things.
